## **What is Privium?**

**Privium** is a cutting-edge software development kit (SDK) designed to help developers and companies implement privacy-preserving analytics, federated learning, and real-time edge computing into their iOS applications. Our mission at Privium is simple:

### **Mission Statement:**
At Privium, we believe that user privacy should never be compromised in the pursuit of data-driven insights. Our mission is to empower companies to harness the power of data while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security. PriviumSDK enables businesses to collect, process, and analyze data directly on users' devices, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and anonymous.

### **How Privium Works:**
PriviumSDK leverages advanced technologies like **federated learning**, **differential privacy**, **encryption**, and **edge computing** to process data on the user’s device rather than sending it to external servers. This ensures that personal information is never exposed, allowing companies to build trust with their users while still gaining valuable insights.

- **Federated Learning:** Train machine learning models directly on users' devices without the need to transfer raw data to the cloud.
- **Differential Privacy:** Anonymize data by adding noise, ensuring that individual data points cannot be traced back to a specific user.
- **Edge Computing:** Process and analyze data locally on the device for faster, more secure insights.
- **Smart Data Throttling:** Optimize data collection rates dynamically based on device performance, ensuring efficient and effective data processing.
- **Advanced Data Masking:** Apply customizable data masking rules to protect sensitive information based on your specific needs.

## **Getting Started with PriviumSDK**

### **Installation**

You can integrate PriviumSDK into your iOS project using one of the following methods:

#### **1. CocoaPods**

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. To install PriviumSDK using CocoaPods:

1. Add the following to your `Podfile`:

    ```ruby
    pod 'PriviumSDK'
    ```

2. Run `pod install` to install the SDK into your project.

#### **2. Swift Package Manager**

Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. To add PriviumSDK via Swift Package Manager:

1. In your `Package.swift` file, add the following dependency:

    ```swift
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Privium/PriviumSDK.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ]
    ```

2. Run `swift build` to compile the SDK.

#### **3. Manual Installation**

You can also manually integrate PriviumSDK by following these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [Privium iOS SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/Privium/privium-ios-sdk/releases).
2. Drag and drop the `PriviumSDK.framework` file into your Xcode project.
3. Ensure the framework is linked with your target in the Xcode project settings.

## **Integrating PriviumSDK**

### **Step 1: Initialize the SDK**

To start using PriviumSDK, you need to initialize it with a configuration. This configuration includes settings like encryption keys, privacy parameters, and data throttling options.

**Example:**

```swift
import PriviumSDK

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        let config = PriviumConfiguration(encryptionKey: SymmetricKey(size: .bits256), epsilon: 1.0, enableDataThrottling: true)
        PriviumSDK.shared.initialize(with: config)

        return true
    }
}
```

### **Step 2: Tracking Events with Smart Data Throttling**

Once the SDK is initialized, you can start tracking user events. PriviumSDK allows you to collect data, aggregate it, and ensure that it’s securely encrypted before being processed. The smart data throttling feature ensures that data collection is optimized based on device performance.

**Example:**

```swift
PriviumSDK.shared.trackEvent("Product Viewed", properties: ["product_id": "12345", "category": "electronics"])
```

### **Step 3: Using Federated Learning**

PriviumSDK enables you to train machine learning models directly on users’ devices. This means you can personalize your app experience without compromising user privacy.

**Example:**

```swift
import CoreML

let trainingData: [MLFeatureProvider] = [/* your training data here */]

do {
    let modelURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "YourModel", withExtension: "mlmodelc")!
    let federatedLearningModel = try FederatedLearningModel(modelURL: modelURL)
    try federatedLearningModel.trainOnDevice(with: trainingData)
} catch {
    print("Failed to train model: \(error)")
}
```

### **Step 4: Ensuring Privacy with Differential Privacy**

Differential Privacy is a technique that adds noise to data, making it difficult to identify individual users while maintaining the overall accuracy of your data analysis.

**Example:**

```swift
let differentialPrivacy = DifferentialPrivacy(epsilon: 1.0)
let anonymizedData = differentialPrivacy.applyNoise(to: 42.0)
```

### **Step 5: Performing Real-Time Analysis with Edge Computing**

Edge Computing allows you to perform computations directly on the device, reducing latency and improving performance.

**Example:**

```swift
let edgeComputing = EdgeComputing()
let processedData = edgeComputing.performComputation(on: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) { value in
    return value * 2
}
```

### **Step 6: Applying Advanced Data Masking**

Advanced Data Masking allows you to protect sensitive information by applying customizable rules before processing.

**Example:**

```swift
let maskRules = [
    "userId": { value in return "MASKED_USER_ID" },
    "email": { value in return "MASKED_EMAIL" }
]
let maskedProperties = DataMasking.maskData(["userId": "12345", "email": "user@example.com"], maskRules: maskRules)
PriviumSDK.shared.trackEvent("User Signed Up", properties: maskedProperties)
```
