# Best Practices for Using PriviumSDK

## Optimizing Battery Life

To minimize the impact of PriviumSDK on battery life, consider the following best practices:

- **Batch Processing:** Schedule data aggregation at regular intervals rather than processing data in real-time. This reduces the frequency of CPU-intensive operations.
- **Throttling Model Training:** Limit how often on-device models are trained. For instance, train models only when the device is charging or during periods of low usage.
- **Network Optimization:** Only send encrypted data to the server when the device is on Wi-Fi to conserve cellular data and battery.
- **Efficient Use of Encryption:** Encrypt only the most sensitive data, rather than all data, to reduce computational overhead.

## Ensuring Privacy

- **Differential Privacy:** Use differential privacy features to add noise to datasets, ensuring that individual data points cannot be easily identified.
- **Federated Learning:** Train models on-device without transferring raw data to a server. This preserves privacy by ensuring data never leaves the device.

## Performance Optimization

- **Lightweight Models:** Use lightweight machine learning models that are optimized for mobile devices, reducing the strain on system resources.
- **Edge Computing:** Offload as much processing as possible to the device itself (edge computing) to reduce latency and reliance on network connectivity.

## Debugging and Logging

- **Verbose Logging:** Use verbose logging during development to understand how the SDK interacts with your app. Ensure that logging is reduced or disabled in production to save resources.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues with data encryption, model training, or network communication.
